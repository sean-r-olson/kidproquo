# KidProQuo
KidProQuo is a full-stack mobile application to support babysitting co-ops. Coordinating one is a lot of administrative paperwork and groups often fall apart because people are asking for sitters, but not available to “sit” for others. The goals of this application are to reduce the administrative burden, to support transparency, and promote accountability and fairness so all parents are able to have some free time out.
